# Polio Vaccination Coverage and Political Speech Analysis

This repository contains scripts related to the analysis and visualization of polio vaccination coverage, political speech against vaccines made by the former president during the pandemic, and voting trends. The exercise aimed to understand the impact of political speech on parents' decisions to vaccinate their children against polio, as childrenâ€™s vaccination rates in Brazil dropped after the pandemic. The idea was to use the percentage of votes to this president as a mechanism for favouritism and likelihood of accepting the anti-vaccine speech.
